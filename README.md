  When I started this project I was just trying to learn but now I have gone too far to stop. The code that is involved in this project is highly illegal if used in the wrong way. Billions of dollars each year are lost because of exactly this. I decided to build this because I was hacked for a lot of money and since then I have been obsessed with protecting my information. I am now invisible to the virtual world. I learned this all from hacking guides and hacking tools which I have over 50,000 files of them. I am going to be starting an e-commerce store to sell everything I have in copies of copies if I can find out how to do it legally and if not I will use the other internet to have my store. This single project that I have right now is worth $500 however I am putting this together here because I like this place, and then I just plan to sell it later because I still need money. This is the absolute best hacking tool you could ever have and if you do it right, you will have 99% success. It takes work and it's not just one program. Help me learn vscode and GitHub because I'm getting into this world rather than the other one. Thanks. I am pretty much giving you guys free reign as long as you stay with the main goal which is to configure everything so that this is actually perfect. I am a very novice coder. I can write it, but not well so I'm still new to this world. Help me out brotha's
