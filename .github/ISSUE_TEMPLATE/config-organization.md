I have about 4,000 configs for a hacking/carding tool called Anti-Detect 7. What the program does is open up a web browser of your choice and custom design through configs. Your IP address is whatever you want, your fingerprint is whatever you want, you have no prior history. You can do anything over the internet using this tool and you wouldn't get caught. It is untraceable and carders/hackers have been using these for years. I might have bought a few bucks worth of stuff that wasnt my money but I haven't gotten into it big yet because I don't know where my morals stand out about this. 

This is what I want done if you guys can please help. I would like all the configs organized by type of: 
1) Device (phone or labtop)
2) Type of device (Delll, Omen, Android, IOS)
3) The browser type.

I will make more branches (if it's not too late), and feel free to add more. Also feel free to play around with the configs as much as you want, as long as they still look legit and aren't ruined.
